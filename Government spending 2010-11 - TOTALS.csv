UK SPENDING 2010-11,,,,,,
"Public spending by the UK's central government departments, 2010-2011. The figures give a picture of major expenditure but exclude local government spending not controlled by central government. We don't have room to show everything — some programmes are just too small to go here, but this gives a flavour of where your tax pounds go. It also excludes government departments who are predominantly financed by their income, such as the Crown Estate or the Export Credits Guarantee Department",,,,,,
